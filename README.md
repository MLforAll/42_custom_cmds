# custom_cmds

Custom commands I make and use on my computers

# These script are distributed 'AS-IS'

Those are script I use for myself and update when I need it.
The one I use the most is upmods, so it can be updated frequently.

They work on both macOS/OS X and Linux (some commands are only available on one platform tho).

# How To Install

Clone this git repo somewhere and add to your shell's rc file
(i.e .bashrc/.bash_profile/.zshrc/.shrc...)
`source "/path/to/repo/needsourcing/custom_cmds.source"`

Of course, you need to change `/path/to/repo`.

Please note that by default, custom_cmds sets your PS1 prompt. To prevent that, add before sourcing `CUSTOM_CMDS_IGNORE=prompt`.

# If you need to modify them

Fork the repo and adapt the scripts to suit your needs.
