# 42_custom_cmds
Custom commands I make and use for 42 related projects

# These script are distributed 'AS-IS'
Those are script I use for myself and update when I need it.
The one I use the most is upmods, so it can be updated frequently.

# If you need to modify them
Fork the repo and adapt the scripts to suit your needs.
